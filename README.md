For the Analogue Electronics assignment, I designed and analyzed a multi-stage amplifier using bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). The project involved building a three-stage amplifier circuit with two common-emitter (CE) stages and one common-collector (CC) stage, utilizing NPN transistors. The objective was to meet specific requirements, including achieving a mid-band gain of 38-42 dB, a lower cut-off frequency between 0-400 Hz, and an upper cut-off frequency between 1 MHz and 10 MHz, while maintaining power consumption below 1 watt.

The assignment focused on both DC and AC analysis. In the DC analysis, I calculated operating points for each transistor stage to ensure proper biasing. For AC analysis, I used the small signal model to determine the frequency response and gain of the amplifier. LTSpice software was utilized for simulation, allowing me to verify the theoretical calculations and assess the amplifier's performance. The simulation results confirmed that the amplifier met the required specifications.

This project deepened my understanding of multi-stage amplifiers, transistor operation, and the use of simulation tools like LTSpice for circuit analysis.
